# Personal portfolio

This project is a personal website developed with the goal of showing the projects I have worked on and telling a little bit about each one of them. It was built using React and has many interesting features.

One of the main features of the project is internationalization, which was implemented using the i18next library. Additionally, other libraries such as Tailwind, Radix and phosphor icons were used. For the layout, the artificial intelligence Midjourney gave some base ideas that served as inspiration to assemble the interface in Figma before turning it into code.

The website has all texts translated into both English and Portuguese, and also allows the introduction of other languages in the future in an easy way. The project can be accessed at https://marcelohenrique.dev.br/.
